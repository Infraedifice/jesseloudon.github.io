Hi I'm Jesse Loudon, an Azure Consultant / Architect at [Telstra Purple][telstrapurple] and blogger at jloudon.com.

My passion is working with customers to envision, design, and implement solutions which solve key business problems & transform underlying processes with technology.

I also enjoy pursing hands-on technical experience with bleeding edge concepts and love architecting and deploying complex multi-vendor/multi-cloud solutions.

Thankfully Iâ€™m also a dad to a little one who keeps me busy at all times.
