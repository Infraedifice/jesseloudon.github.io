With Microsoft announcing sweeping changes to a few Azure exams later in March 2020 the time is ripe to blog about an exam I’ve had my eye on for a while: Azure DevOps Solutions (AZ-400). This is an advanced exam that targets professionals familiar with Azure administration and Azure development. I can see this exam providing value to engineers, consultants, and architects who are driving for increased adoption of Agile practices and Infrastructure as Code.

# Establish your Rhythm
After doing a few of these exams over the years you’ll find a rhythm that works for you. Here’s mine.

1. Go to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/
2. Search for and go to the relevant exam page (e.g. AZ-400)
3. Download the Exam Skills Outline ![AZ400ExamSkillsOutline](/assets/images/AZ400SkillsMeasured.png)
4. Create a repository of study resources (docs, images, links, etc)
5. Book the Exam!
6. Absorb Content, Get Hands-On, Take Notes, Review Review Review!
7. Pass the Exam!
8. Celebrate!

# General thoughts on exams which may help you.

* Book the exam early on after taking a look at the exam skills outline as you will need to estimate how much study time is needed. I generally book the exam in 1-2 months time.

*  Being a ‘morning person’ I book exams about 10:00am and make sure to arrive at least 20 mins early to the test centre. I have a light breakfast and a quick review of my notes on the morning of the test.

*  No coffee before an exam unless I’ve had a sleepless night as it can make me more nervous and jittery. BTW – nerves before exams are completely normal and I’ve learnt to embrace them as part of the experience.

*  During the test I use the scratch pad to take notes on questions I have trouble with. Writing something, anything, down is also a tactic to reduce stress and maintain focus rather than just staring at the test question on the screen.

*  Creating your own study guide helps with tracking progress as you will need to break your study time across days/weeks to suit your schedule.

* I try not to tackle every subject and dedicate sufficient time and energy to my weakest areas to ensure I have a broad understanding.

* After passing the exam – creating content and sharing it with the community is a great way to contribute and say “thanks” to those that helped you in your study journey.

# AZ-400 Exam Section Weighting
You can use this image as a guide when planning your study time for AZ-400. For example if you had to choose between dedicating study time on Design a DevOps Strategy vs Implement Continuous Feedback I would choose the former as the weighting is higher and there is likely to be more test questions on that section.

# AZ-400 Exam Skills Outline

I’ve copied the exam skills outline from Microsoft and created simple imagery below to aid you with an overview of each section. Important to note that there is often duplication of subject areas across different exam sections so having a broad understanding of the content is important and also hands-on experience through labs.
